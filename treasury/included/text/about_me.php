<h2>About me</h2>
  <h4>
    Having worked for several years in Finance / Treasury in a small service company belonging to a large international Gr. I finally decided to persue interests in IT field, to take a new challenge and reorient professionally to coding. First real step towards that was to start studying IT and coding (a/a JAVA, HTML, CSS and SQL) as Post-Graduate in '18 by Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. After 1 year of intense studying I graduated. Recently I've also earned certificates in JS, PHP,HTML, CSS and SQL. As well I touched base on BootStarp and jQery. For a few months I've devoted much more time to coding, that even though it is absorbing quite much time it indeed gives lots of satisfaction. Ready to work in Web Development with strong commitment to grow and ultimately become regular Fullstack Developer. I am excited to start entirely new chapter in my carreer and am confident to manage.
